# LEDCube

This project contains the arduino code for the 4x4x4 Blue LED Cube I created. This is my first attempt at working with a LED Cube. 

For this project, I am using shift registers to control all the pins needed for the LED Cube. I have an Arduino Nano controlling the cube as well as 5 input buttons that can change the configuration of the pattern currently being displayed on the cube.
